            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>My first time ever coming across coding of any sort were in my gymnasium years, between the age of 16-19. I studied tech/it and from the start i found it very interesting.
               After i graduated, my thoughout path towards tech and engineering, suddenly got replaced by an opportunity to follow a dream of mine and play e-Sports professionally.
               I have since then travelled the world, lived in Singapore and Los Angeles and competed against the best players in the world in Counter-Strike & Valorant.
               My e-Sports career was a successful one, as i managed to achieve top-rankings in the world as a captain and leader for the teams i played with.
            </p>
            <p>With that chapter finished, i was ready to start another, and i decided that i want to switch paths. So now, im working towards becoming the best developer i can be, and having fun while doing it.
                My passion for always wanting to learn more, and my interest in tech has now set me on this journey to try and learn about this new world of software development. To be continued..
