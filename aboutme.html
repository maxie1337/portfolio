            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>My first time ever coming across coding of any sort were in my gymnasium years, between 16-19. I studied tech/it and from the start i found it very interesting.
               After i graduated, my thoughout path towards tech and engineering, suddenly got replaced by an opportunity to become a professional CS player.
               Since 2014, and until 2023 i have been playing PC games as a professional, and i have had the benefit to travel the world, and live my boyhood dream.
               I reached top 20 in the world in Counter-Strike, and i have also played a game called Valorant as a professional player, captain and leader. I managed to
               reach #3 in Asia, and top 16 in the world. 
            </p>
            <p>Inbetween jobs in the e-Sport world, i also found a passion in teaching physical education. I applied to University, and i graduated as a teacher in 2023.
               But i have always had that itch for tech, and whilst i was working as a teacher, i decided that i want to switch paths. So now, im working towards becoming the best developer i can be, and having fun while doing it.
